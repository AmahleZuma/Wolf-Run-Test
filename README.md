# This is a tutorial based game(test) I made to teach me about OOP and gamedev with JS
# What I learned:

1. Making a Game, even a concept with the basic game mechanics, from scratch is extrememly diffficult and takes time
2. Web Technologies are great for turn based games (quizzes, tests, spot the difference, kahoot), but not so much for frame by frame demanding games. That's where Unity/Unreal and Godot come in
3. How to write basic OOP
4. How to build while having fun
5. Okay I'm going back on my word a but it's fun
